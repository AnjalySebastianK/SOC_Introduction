# SOC FUNDAMENTALS

## a. Security Operations Center (SOC)
- A SOC is a centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats.
- It operates 24/7 to ensure continuous protection of an organization’s digital assets.
- Core objectives:
  - Maintain visibility over networks, systems, and logs.
  - Detect suspicious or malicious activity early.
  - Respond to incidents quickly to minimize damage.
  - Improve security posture through continuous monitoring and threat intelligence.

## b. SOC Hierarchy — L1, L2, L3 Roles

### L1 — Tier 1 Analyst (Monitoring & Triage)
- First line of defense.
- Monitors alerts from SIEM and security tools.
- Performs initial triage: validates alerts, checks severity, gathers basic context.
- Escalates real incidents to L2.

### L2 — Tier 2 Analyst (Investigation & Deep Analysis)
- Performs detailed investigation of escalated alerts.
- Analyzes logs, correlates events, identifies root cause.
- Contains threats (blocking IPs, isolating hosts).
- Provides recommendations and creates incident reports.

### L3 — Tier 3 Analyst / Threat Hunter / SME
- Handles complex or high‑severity incidents.
- Performs malware analysis, forensics, and advanced threat hunting.
- Develops detection rules, improves SIEM use cases.
- Works with engineering teams to strengthen defenses.

## c. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- SOPs are documented, step‑by‑step instructions that define how SOC tasks must be performed.
- Purpose:
  - Ensure consistency and repeatability.
  - Reduce errors during investigations.
  - Provide clear guidance for analysts at all levels.
  - Standardize incident handling, escalation, communication, and reporting.

## d. Incident Response Plan (IRP)
- A structured plan outlining how an organization prepares for, detects, responds to, and recovers from security incidents.
- Key importance:
  - Ensures coordinated and efficient response.
  - Minimizes downtime, data loss, and business impact.
  - Defines roles, communication channels, and escalation paths.
  - Helps maintain compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

## e. Ticketing System
- A platform used to track, document, and manage security alerts and incidents.
- Functions:
  - Creates tickets for every alert or task.
  - Records investigation steps, evidence, and analyst notes.
  - Supports escalation between L1 → L2 → L3.
  - Provides audit trails and reporting.

- Workflow:
  1. Alert generated by SIEM or security tool.
  2. Ticket automatically or manually created.
  3. Analyst triages, investigates, and updates the ticket.
  4. Escalation if needed.
  5. Ticket closed after resolution and documentation.

- Common tools:
  - ServiceNow
  - JIRA
  - Remedy
  - TheHive
  - RTIR

## f. Incident Workflows
- The structured process SOC teams follow to handle security incidents.

### Typical Workflow:
1. **Identification**  
   - Detect suspicious activity via SIEM, EDR, logs, or alerts.
   - Validate whether it is a true incident.

2. **Analysis**  
   - Gather evidence, correlate logs, determine scope and impact.
   - Identify affected systems, attacker behavior, and root cause.

3. **Containment**  
   - Short‑term: isolate affected hosts, block malicious IPs/domains.  
   - Long‑term: apply patches, change credentials, update rules.

4. **Eradication**  
   - Remove malware, close vulnerabilities, eliminate persistence.

5. **Recovery**  
   - Restore systems to normal operation.
   - Monitor for reinfection or residual activity.

6. **Lessons Learned**  
   - Document findings, update SOPs, improve detection rules.
   - Strengthen defenses to prevent recurrence.
